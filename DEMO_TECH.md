#DEMO_TECH

> We followed an agile software development lifetime cycle model

- First we defined our minimal viable product then we broke the process into several scrum sessions.
- Some scrum sessions where over in as little as 30 minutes, others went for hours.
- Once the Minimum Viable Product was reached we focused on developing a more inviting interface with natural interactions

> To create more interactive scenarios that encouraged critical thinking from the students and built positive rapport between the character and the student we:

- Emphasized the importance of the student's decisions on the characters academics, social and future opportunities.
- Made scenarios span actual conversations creating a natural flow that draws in the user.
- Students are rewarded for making good choices with trophies that increase their skills socially, academically, and introduce new opportunities for the characters.
- Ultimately the character should with the help of participating students graduate.

> To build our app we used Android Studio, leveraging the accessible and easy to learn IDE.
