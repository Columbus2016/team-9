# Demo

> We approached the app as an interactive and educational choose your own adventure game. 
The goal being to encourage the student to make increasingly good choices.

- The game begins with an intro screen that allows students to choose their character. 
- Students are shown a pictorial description of the character. Including their likes and dislikes.
I’ll be demoing our prototype with character 1.

- To create a more interactive experience we made our scenarios span actual conversations.
- The character based on the student’s responses made their choices.

> To simulate a multi-dimensional game of cause, effect and branching themes, we broadened the factors affecting characters.

- Student decisions affect the characters academic and social life.
- Certain decisions may increase social status or future oppurtunities at the expense of the the character's academic life
- Students are encouraged to work towards certain goals that increase their characters academic and social status
- The goal is that the characters graduate.
