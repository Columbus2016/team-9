# Demo

> We approached the app as an interactive and educational choose your own adventure game. 
The goal being to encourage the student to make increasingly good choices.

- The game begins with an intro screen that allows students to choose their character. 
- Students are shown a pictorial description of the character. Including their likes and dislikes.
- The demo will be based on interactions based on character 1.

- To create a more interactive experience we made our scenarios span actual conversations.
- The character based on the studentâ€™s responses made their choices.

> To simulate a multi-dimensional game of cause, effect and branching themes, we broadened the factors affecting characters.

- Student decisions affect the characters academic and social life.
- Certain decisions may increase social status or future oppurtunities at the expense of the the character's academic life.
- Students are encouraged to work towards certain goals that increase their characters academic and social status.
- The goal is that the characters graduate. 

> Moving forward, the plan is to expand on the existing characters

- Students are given the opportuity to walk through more scenarios after the daily scenarios.
- Past decisions will reflect on future scenarios and interactions.
- CHaracter decisisons will impaact their interactions with others in their school.
- The setup currently would allow for new scenarios to be added by the CHOICES program team.
