#DEMO PRESENTATION

> Choices is an organization dedicated to increasing the retention and graduating rate for at risk youth between the ages of 13 and 18

- Our goal was to create an interactive and educational choose your own adventure game that promotes and encourages the student participants to make better choices.
- The game begins with an intro screen that allows students to choose their character.
- Students are shown a pictorial description of the character. Including their likes and dislikes.
- The demo will be based on interactions based on character 1.
- To create a more interactive experience we made our scenarios span actual conversations.
- The character based on the studentâ€™s responses made their choices.

> To simulate a multi-dimensional game of cause, effect and branching themes, we broadened the factors affecting characters.
Student decisions affect the characters academic and social life.

- Certain decisions may increase social status or future opportunities at the expense of the the character's academic life.
- Students are encouraged to work towards certain goals that increase their characters academic and social status.
- The goal is that the characters graduate.

> Moving forward, the plan is to expand on the existing characters

- Students are given the opportunity to walk through more scenarios after the daily scenarios.
- Past decisions will reflect on future scenarios and interactions.
- Character decisions will impact their interactions with others in their school.
- The setup currently would allow for new scenarios to be added by the CHOICES program team.
